                                There are four main types of state you need to properly manage in React apps:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Local state</li>
                                    <li>Global state</li>
                                    <li>Server state</li>
                                    <li>Server state</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>useState is the first tool you should reach for to manage state in your components.</p>
                                <p>useReducer is another option that can be used for either local or global state. It is similar in many ways to useState under the hood, although instead of just an initial state it accepts a reducer</p>
                                <p>URL state is quite easy to manage, usually through custom hooks that give us all the information we need about our location, history, and pathname.
                                    If we are using React Router, you can get all the information you need using useHistory or useLocation.</p>

                                The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object, we use Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.setPrototypeOf. Nowadays, in modern language, it is being set using __proto__.

                                Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation. This testing methodology is done during the development process by the software developers and sometimes QA staff.  The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to test and determine if it works as intended.

                                Unit testing is an important step in the development process, because if done correctly, it can help detect early flaws in code which may be more difficult to find in later testing stages.
